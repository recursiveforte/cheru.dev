Hello, world!
=============

I'm **Cheru Berhanu (ቸርነት ብርሃኑ)**, a high school sophomore. I play violin & make things with code.

I spend most of my free time making code work at my local [robotics team](https://essexrobotics.org),
leading a [coding club](https://essexhacks.org/) at my school, 
working on small software projects, and practicing violin. Right now, I'm working on [Damien Invasion](https://damien.cx).

You can find me on GitHub as [recursiveforte](https://github.com/recursiveforte) and email me at [cheru@cheru.dev](mailto:cheru@cheru.dev). Also, check out [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) if you’re a teenager interested in tech.
