Hello, world!
=============

I'm **Cheru Berhanu (ቸርነት ብርሃኑ)**: a fifteen-year-old programmer, violinist, and high school student based in Vermont, USA.

I spend the majority of my free time programming for my local [robotics team](https://essexrobotics.org),
leading a [coding club](https://essexhacks.org/) at my school, 
working on small software projects, and practicing violin.

Here's some other things I've done:
- Organized Hack Club's [Epoch VT](https://epochvt.hackclub.com), Vermont's first high school hackathon.
- Created [tick](https://github.com/recursiveforte/tick), a terminal metronome in Go.
- [In progress] [Damien Invasion](https://damien.cx), a combination of an art installation and a Space-Invaders-style game.

You can find me on GitHub as [recursiveforte](https://github.com/recursiveforte) and email me at [cheru@cheru.dev](mailto:cheru@cheru.dev). Also check out [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) if you're a teenager interested in tech.
